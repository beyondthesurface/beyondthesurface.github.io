title: "Is Tech Really Advancing Us?"

From the Cold War to Apple vs. Samsung, individuals, companies, and even countries seem to be in an endless technological race. Having the most advanced tech and being the first one to improve or create something revolutionary can be a source of pride, but there are quite a few hidden negatives that I'd like to bring to light.

DISCLAIMER: I acknowledge that technology has helped make many processes more efficient and I do not necessarily claim that the negatives outweigh the positives.

Many argue that technology has introduces many new jobs into the workforce, but what about all the jobs it destroys? As machinery improves, factory workers lose their jobs. Unskilled workers would have to be retrained, which they can't always afford. This leaves them unemployed, and instead of helping them, we maintain focus on improving technology further, to take away more of these unskilled workers' jobs. As artificial intelligence technologies advance, even skilled workers are beginning to lose their jobs. Those whose jobs can be regulated are all at risk, which means even those with the highest of educations need to watch out. If I choose to study a certain technology in college, it might become obsolete by the time I graduate with the skills to use it. To accommodate the speed of technological advancement, the educational system would have to undergo a reform. Just like in the movie I, Robot, our world will be taken over by robots soon enough.

What's the main reason Mars exploration exists? To find an alternate planet to potentially sustain life, should anything happen to Earth. Why don't we focus on fixing the situation on Earth first? I was discussing with my friend once about how the Earth's global warming condition would degrade so much during our generation itself. I do agree that we should simultaneously look for a solution if nothing works out, but working to save the planet that allows us to breathe every day should be a top priority, especially with its rapidly worsening condition. We have world hunger, climate change, and a bucketload of other problems to solve, so I hope I'm not alone in thinking that maybe we should give these current issues a second thought.
