Time is money. So what? We hear it too often. But someone once explained it to me in a way that changed my perspective on the dreaded concept of "time management" forever. 

Imagine if you had $24 to spend every day. Go through your daily expenses. For me, sleep costs $7, eating costs $1, and school costs around $11. Homework is around $3, so per workweek, I've got $10 to spend.

I can choose to spend it watching cat videos on Youtube. Or I can choose to spend it doing something I enjoy while making a difference in the world. In the end, it's up to me.
